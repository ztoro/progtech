A student has a name, nationality, and an average of their grades.

1. Create a new project and implement the Student class! Create a constructor, 
and add setters and getters for the class fields.
2. Extend your program with an ArrayList that contains Student objects. 
Read in a few students into the ArrayList and print out which student has 
the best and the worst average (using the proper algorithms).
3. List the students who receive a scholarship! 
A student receives a scholarship if their average is at least 4.0.
